## #Task: 
To build machine learning model and convert into  app that can predict the salary of an employee
# Functionality:
This app takes in inputs such as employee's years of experience, test score and interview score to estimate the salary of the employee.
# Description
The project aims to lessen the burden of Head of Recruitment(HR) by making it easier for the HR to predict the salary of an employee.
This project is an end to end project where I explored the data, engineered the features, test models and deployed the best model into the Flask app.
The following steps where followed;
1) Feature Engineering: missing values where handled
2) Exporatory data analysis:Explored the data for insight
4) Feature Scaling: standard scaler was used
5) Use machine learning pipeline to test three models
6) Perform hyperperameter tuning and select the best model
7) Create and save a pickle file using the best model
8) Use the pickle file to build a flask app and deploy on heroku

# Performance metric
MAE is 1739.82

MSE is 4167482.00

RMSE is 2041.44
